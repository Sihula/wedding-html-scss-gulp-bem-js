              <h4 class="faq__item-title">WHY IS IT BETTER TO HIRE PHOTO AND VIDEO FROM ONE TEAM?</h4>
              <p class="faq__item-text">Wedding photographers and videographers are performing the same job, and to do
                it
                well they need the same elements- flattering angles, good lighting, right timing.When they work as a
                team,
                their working process resembles a dance where each one knows how to move, so both of them get what they
                need. They focus on this flow instead of competing with each other for the best material, as it often
                happens when two strangers are hired, each to do his own business.</p>
              <h4 class="faq__item-title">MAY I CUSTOMISE MY PHOTO AND VIDEO POST PRODUCTION?</h4>
              <p class="faq__item-text">Most of our clients give us the full creative power over their wedding photos
                and
                videos and trust that we will use our skills and knowledge to polish it to its maximum potential.
                However,
                sometimes clients request a specific style of colouring or a particular soundtrack for their videos, and
                that is fine with us.
              </p>
              <h4 class="faq__item-title">WILL MY PHOTOGRAPHS AND VIDEOS LOOK THE SAME?</h4>
              <p class="faq__item-text">Yes, we colour grade our materials identically in order to maintain a uniform
                style. Most of our clients prefer natural looking colour correction, with deep hues and timeless feel to
                it, so that is what we strive for unless requested differently.</p>
